# Super-Apocalux
Open source game for SNES emulation.
V1.0


This game is a work in progress rom intended to be used by SNES emulation programs.
I have not and do not intend to test this game on an actual Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
The goal of the project was to teach myself assembly and I feel I've reached that goal, at least as far as I want to.
If you would like to see the project continued please let me know. A donation or even just a request could go a long way.
I don't think the market for a new SNES style game is big, so speaking up could change a lot. I also don't have a job right now so you can get me working on this for nearly nothing.

This game is open source and I'd like it to be accessible. Please let me know if you have questions about how it works.
If you would like to clone this game keep in mind that the game is under the GNUv3 license. This includes romhacks. I welcome romhacks you are even allowed to charge money for them provided you include source code.

When it comes to the gray area of the law that is video recording of games, I would like best to make it a legal requirement to provide source code or information about where a source code for the viewed game can be downloaded. Unfortunately I don't think I can do this with the GNU so if anyone knows a solution for that I would appreciate it.

If you would like to host this game you are free to do so provided you distribute it with this readme file or a link to this github page.

The game currently is just hopping on platforms and not falling. In the future I would like to have some bad guys that drop items that you can equip. I'd also like to add in safe zones that saves the game and would allow you to select new stages. Each zone would have different sets of monsters and you would be given a fixed time for how long you could spend in each stage, if you didn't reach the next safe zone in that time you would lose.

The story:
A unknown biological weapon was unleashed on the world and it's effects ran out of control. You may be the last non-mutated survivor. The roads below are infested with mutants and as the sun sets they become even more violent. Your only hope is to run towards the sun long enough that you might find a safe place to lay for the night. If you are quiet you can sleep and escape before they sniff you out and find a new place to hide the next day.
